# Introduction
We have seen various applications of Deep Learning in classification problems in computer vision.
Here, we use similar principles to train the neural network to reconstruct the Ice bed and air bed boundaries (more about this below)

# Problem Statement
Glaciology has always been an interesting field of study, and the whether and climatic changes can be studied extensively in this field.
One of the applications of Glaciology is to estimate the Ice bed surfaces (or any other kind of bed surfaces for that matter) below the ice sheets of Arctic / Antarctic region.
Long time back, this was done by digging the bed surfaces. But this is inefficient in many terms.

In past few decades, Radar signals are being effectively used to study the underlying structure of the ice sheets.
